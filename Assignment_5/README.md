# Assignment 5

## 1. What is statically typed and dynamically typed Programming Language ?

- In Static Typing, type checking is **performed during compile time**. Whereas in Dynamic Typing, type checking is **performed at runtime**.

## 2. What is the variable in java ?

- A variable is a **container which holds the value** while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a **name of memory location**. There are three types of variables in java: **local, instance and static**.

## 3. How to assign a value to variable ?

- After creating a variable name with its required data type on the left side and then by using assignment operator in between finally we initialise the value after that on the right side. **For example : int num = 9;** .

## 4. What are Primitive Data type in Java ?

- In Java language, primitive data types are the building blocks of data manipulation. These are the most basic data types available in Java language. There are 8 types of primitive data types: **boolean data type, byte data type, char data type, short data type, int data type, long data type, float data type, double data type**.


## 5. What are the Identifiers in Java ?

- Identifiers in Java are **symbolic names used for identification**. They can be a class name, variable name, method name, package name, constant name, and more. However, In Java, There are **some reserved words that can not be used as an identifier**.

## 6. List the Operators in Java ?

- The list of Operators present in Java are **Arithmetic Operators, Assignment Operators, Relational Operators, Logical Operators, Unary Operators, Bitwise Operators** .


## 7. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples. 

- These are the operators which are used for increasing and decreasing the value of a int type variable by 1 at a time. And these operation can also occur in two ways post increment / decrement and pre increment and decrement. For example lets consider a integer type variable **int num= 5;** Now :-  
- **num++;** (Here the value of num is increase by +1, after using the variable value).
- **++num;** (Here the value of num is increase by +1, before using the variable value).
-  **num--;** (Here the value of num is decrease by -1, after using the variable value).
- **--num;** (Here the value of num is decrease by -1, before using the variable value).
